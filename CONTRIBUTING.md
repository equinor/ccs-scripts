## Contributing to ccs-scripts

Please feel free to make contact if you have any suggestions, questions or bugs to report, for instance using the [discussions tab](https://github.com/equinor/ccs-scripts/discussions). It is possible to see the list of known tasks (bugs or new features) at [issues](https://github.com/equinor/ccs-scripts/issues).

We recommend new contributors to first make contact and discuss the suggestions, before starting to write new code and make pull requests.

The code has some standard formating checks that runs for each new pull request. Note that we use main as the stable branch, while the develop branch can contain new features not yet fully tested.
