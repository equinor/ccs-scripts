# Running on Azure

## üéØ Goal

In order to run your simulations on Azure, you will need to have access to an Azure subscription and create a dedicated project space on the subscription. 
A step-by-step guide is available below.


## üìù Set-by-step

1. Access to the following is a <span style="background-color: #DFF5FF">pre-requesite</span>:

    - [Unix Basic Access](https://accessit.equinor.com/Search/Search?term=UNIX+BASIC+ACCESS)
    - [HP Remote Graphics Receiver Windows](https://accessit.equinor.com/Search/Search?term=HP+REMOTE+GRAPHICS+RECEIVER+WINDOWS) 
<br />
<br />

2. To gain <span style="background-color: #DFF5FF">access to Azure</span> and <span style="background-color: #DFF5FF">create your project area</span>, send a request to Hans Rune Bue (TDI OG SUB HPC-team) with the following information. Content highlighted in bold needs to be changed according to your needs:

    - Email title:
    >"Request for extra CCS project into the S268 subscription"
    - Email core:
        - Create your project area and space: 
        >We request: 10 TB for /project/**[project_name]** and at least 10 TB for /scratch/**[project_name]** on subscription S268. 
        - Add your "on-premise" unix group if you have one and add short names of people who should have access:
        >The unix group owner should be **[unix_group_name]**, ref the **[unix_group_name]** group ‚ÄúOn-Premise‚Äù: 
        >getent group: **[list of short names]**
        - Number of RGS machines:
        >We also request extra **[nb]** RGS-machines in the S268 RGS-pool if this is possible to deliver.

    You should now have access to Azure and have a dedicated area to work on - congratulations! üèÜ

3. You will need to <span style="background-color: #DFF5FF">recreate your .cshrc file</span> in your home directory. This file contains all the system-wide settings (alias, visual settings, etc).

### Tips & tricks

- ResInsight: `/prog/ResInsight/script/resinsight`
<br />
<br />
- To check if jobs are running correctly:‚Äã

    `qstat` - Check if job is running (H: Hold, Q: Queue, R: Run)

    `qstat ‚Äìf [jobID]` - Get more info on the run ‚Äã

    `qdel jobID` - Delete job
<br />

    Remember to change the highlighted sections.

    If you are using another subscirption than S268, update with your own subscription number.
